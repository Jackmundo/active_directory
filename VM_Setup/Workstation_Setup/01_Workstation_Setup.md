# 01 - Workstation Setup 

1. Select a hyper-visor of your choice
    - There's a wide plethora of hyper-visors out there.
    - VM Workstation
    - Virtual Box
    - As mentioned, you could put this on Azure/AWS - but it's mainly about how much you're going to use as they charge based on usage.

2. Get the ISO file from Microsoft
    - Pretty self explainatory, grab an ISO from Microsoft and then get installing!

3. Get the VM up and running
 - Once your VM is up and running, take a quick snapshot so you don't have to spend time reinstalling the ISO, simply just a clone & redeploy :)
