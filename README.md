# Active Directory Home Lab

This will help walk you through setting up your own AD home lab. Whether you're wanting to learn how to deploy software through SCCM or wanting to learn how various attacks can be executed on AD, this guide is for you.

You can potentially deploy this via AWS or Azure, but you will need to be careful as they will charge for usage of the VMs, that's why I opted for the locally hosted approach :)

I'll try my best to update the repository with tools & various other things to add to your environment. I may drop an AutoPilot guide in the Github too.

I've also added some other tutorials/guides here for further learning :)

Enjoy!
